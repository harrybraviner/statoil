# Dataset notes

 * Training dataset contains 1604 images. Can I augment these (e.g. relections) usefully?
 * Can I do translations and rotations on training dataset? Could if I was prepared to 'zero' much of the background.
 
# Design notes

* Small dataset, regularization really matters! Use dropout.
